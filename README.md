INTRODUCTION
 Introduction
RSA encryption and decryption algorithm talks about secrecy of messages between two users. Itinvolves a public key and a private key generation. The public key can be known to everyoneand is used for encrypting messages. Messages encrypted with the public key can only bedecrypted using the private key. The private key is not publicly known, it is only known toreceiver so that sheî€€he can decrypt the encrypted message. These keys !public and private keys"for the RSA algorithm are generated using some mathematical operations. The principal goal of design of any encryption algorithm must be security against unauthori#edattacks. $ithin the last decade, there has been a vast increase in the accumulation andcommunication of digital computer data in both the private and public sectors. Much of thisinformation has a significant value, either directly or indirectly, which re%uires protection. RSAis an Asymmetric key cryptography which provides security against unauthori#ed attacks.&roblem 'efinition $hat is RSA Algorithm and mathematics behind it ( RSA Algorithm) Someidea of RSA algorithm has been given in abstract above. *ou may refer that again for moreinformation. The encryption and decryption in the RSA algorithm as follows) +irst, I had togenerate the key pair and then those keys were to be used for encryption and decryption. Key generation RSA involves a public key and a private key. The mathematics behind RSA algorithmis as follows

Project Description Snapshot
In this class file, RSA algorithm related functions are available like calculating phi, n, square, and modulus. RSA algorithm is step in this project to encrypt and decrypt text. This algorithm encrypts and decrypts the plane text, i.e., each text gets encrypted and decrypted.
The Main Concepts In this project, takes as input, in console user section, , After taking input, HEX function extracts the text HEX code, HEX code is converted into cipher text depending on RSA settings. An opposite, Cipher text gets loaded, then apply RSA algorithm, then decipher the text, resultant string is converted .
